        "Quantum Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most important problems in quantum computing. It consists in modeling the time evolution of a quantum system, ruled by some not natively executable Hamiltonian in a specific device. Simulations of this type are essential to comprehend quantum systems that are described by a complex dynamics, such as molecules in chemistry or materials in condensed matter physics, where classical computers fail due the exponential scale up required by larger quantum systems.\n",
